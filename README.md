WiSys VentureHome - Eau Claire application submission: https://www.venturehome.org/join-the-cohort-fall-2021

## COMPANY OVERVIEW 
Provide basic information about your startup, including name, age of company, founders, your goals for the company, etc. (e.g. manage long-term, seek acquisition, seek investment funding, etc.). 

> I've been working on the software, on and off, for a couple of years now. It has the capacity to fully disrupt the entire music industry. It allows consumers to pay artists, empowers individual record labels to become music distributers, and incentivises internet streamers.

> Think of it as a jukebox system for anywhere you'd hear a song that you didn't specifically play.

## PROBLEM DEFINITION

What is the problem your product/service will solve? What is the current solution for this problem and how is your solution better?

> Services like Spotify have made music streaming accessable to consumers that stream music for personal use. In music copyright law, this is called "Mechanical Rights". Streaming for public consumption is called "Performance Rights".

> The music industry is very old, and Performance Rights are in need of disruption for the sake of our artists.

## PRODUCT OR SERVICE DESCRIPTION *
Describe your product/service in detail. If the product is technical, please use general terms. Who are your competitors? Describe what attributes make your product/service better than competitors.

>A service for the uploading, and viewing of artists audio is available at http://jukedec.com. This will allow to build a "library" of audio to be accessed by consumers who can legally pay for it to be publically broadcast.

> A consumer can find a song from the "library", and pay to play it at a "venue". Venues could include brick-and-mortar establishments, but they also include things like radio broadcasts and internet content creators.

> Touchtunes is a competitor that has puts jukeboxes in brick-and-mortar establishments across the country. Music played in grocery stores is goverened by these same laws. There are no real competitors in the digital space.

## CUSTOMER NEEDS *
Who is your customer? Who would be an early user of your product/service? If you have validated your customerâ€™s needs (customer interviews/market testing), please describe your efforts.

> An easy early customer would be the fans of internet streamers. Fans of internet content creators always look to interact with creators, and often willingly donate substantial sums of money as donations for various non-substantial benefits. The internet is a silly place.

## MARKET DEFINITION *
Explain your target customer and the size of the market you are targeting.

> Internet content creators will have a new source of revenue, as well as new outlet to interact with their fans.

## DEVELOPMENT STAGE *
Describe where you are in the development of your product/service, i.e. idea stage, working prototype, fully developed, or anything in between. 

> I am in the beginning stage of writing the software that will attract musicians to the platform and allow a music library to be built.

> For legal reasons, a distributed system of libraries is necessary to perserve an ecosystem of artists and record-labels at scale, and allow for a measure of control on illegal publishing of audio (music pirating)

> Only trusted sources will be allowed to garner revenue from the audio "libraries" where music files are hosted.

> Current software development can be found at https://github.com/jukedec

## ADDITIONAL TEAM MEMBERS *
What help/advice have you sought out while thinking through or launching your business? If you have any mentors or partners, please list them here and include their role and area of expertise.

> Though I have consulted many business-minded folks, I am the only stakeholder at the moment.

## CURRENT AND ANTICIPATED ISSUES *
What are your current and anticipated issues that affect the launch or growth of your business? 

> Most artists don't have publishing deals. But when artists that are currently published through ASCAP and BMI (the Performance-Rights Organizations of the United States) want to be published through this service, I will need legal council.

## GOALS *
What do you hope to accomplish through this program? 

> Networking. I hope to meet folks that will help me structure a plan so that I can hire developers to finish the software.
